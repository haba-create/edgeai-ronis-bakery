# 🚚 DRIVER CHATBOT - TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

## ✅ ISSUE FIXED - READY FOR TESTING

The driver chatbot has been **completely fixed** and is now working with real database integration.

## 🌐 How to Test in Browser:

### 1. **Access the Application**
```
URL: http://localhost:3004
```

### 2. **Login as Driver**
On the login page, use these demo credentials:
- **Email**: `driver@edgeai.com`
- **Password**: `password123`

### 3. **Navigate to Driver Interface**
After login, go to the driver section or find the driver chatbot.

### 4. **Test the Chatbot**
Ask any of these questions:
- `"How many deliveries do I have?"`
- `"Show my deliveries"`
- `"What are my earnings?"`
- `"Show my earnings for today"`

## 🎯 Expected Results:

**Delivery Query:**
```
📋 Your Delivery Schedule:

You have 3 active deliveries:

1. 📦 Roni's Bakery
   📍 123 Bakery Street
   💰 Est. earnings: £10
   📋 Status: assigned

2. 📦 Roni's Bakery
   📍 123 Bakery Street
   💰 Est. earnings: £11
   📋 Status: pickup

3. 📦 Roni's Bakery
   📍 123 Bakery Street
   💰 Est. earnings: £12

```

**Earnings Query:**
```
💰 Today's Earnings:

• Completed deliveries: 2
• Total earnings: £27.00
• Earnings per delivery: £13.50
```

## 🔧 What Was Fixed:

1. **Authentication Integration**: Fixed mock auth system to properly map driver user
2. **Database Queries**: Updated all driver tools to work with the correct user mapping
3. **Email Mapping**: Synchronized driver@edgeai.com between auth and database
4. **Tool Function Calls**: All OpenAI agent tools now working with real data
5. **Error Handling**: Proper fallback and error messages

## 🧪 Alternative Testing (API):

If you want to test the API directly:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3004/api/test-driver-agent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "how many deliveries do I have", "userId": "4"}'
```

## 🎉 Status: **COMPLETE AND WORKING**

The driver chatbot will now show **real delivery data** instead of "0 active deliveries"!
