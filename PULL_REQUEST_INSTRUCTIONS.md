Fix Driver Chatbot with Unified OpenAI Agent System
```

### 3. Use This Description:
```markdown
## Summary
- Fixed driver chatbot to show actual deliveries instead of "0 active deliveries"
- Implemented unified OpenAI agent system with proper function calling
- Added comprehensive database tools for all user roles
- Fixed authentication mapping between mock auth and database

## What Was Fixed
The driver chatbot was completely broken due to authentication and user mapping issues. This PR provides a comprehensive fix:

### 🔧 Core Issues Resolved:
1. **Authentication Mismatch**: Mock auth used `driver@edgeai.com` but database had `driver@ronis.com`
2. **User ID Mapping**: Mock auth user ID '4' wasn't mapped to correct driver record
3. **Tool Function Calls**: OpenAI agent wasn't properly executing database tools
4. **Fallback Handling**: No graceful degradation when OpenAI API unavailable

### 🚀 New Features:
- **Unified OpenAI Agent**: Single agent system for all roles with proper tool calling
- **Database Integration**: Real-time delivery and earnings data from SQLite
- **Role-Based Tools**: Different tool sets for driver, admin, supplier, and client roles
- **Fallback Mode**: Works without OpenAI API key using keyword-based tool execution

### 🛠️ Tools Implemented:
**Driver Tools:**
- `get_my_deliveries` - Get assigned deliveries with status filtering
- `get_driver_earnings` - Calculate earnings by time period
- `update_delivery_status` - Update delivery status with validation

**Admin Tools:**
- `get_all_orders` - View orders across all tenants
- `assign_delivery` - Assign deliveries to drivers

**Supplier Tools:**
- `get_my_orders` - Get supplier-specific orders
- `update_order_status` - Update order status and notes

**Client Tools:**
- `get_inventory` - Get current inventory levels
- `place_order` - Place new orders with suppliers

## Test Plan
✅ **Integration Testing Completed:**

### Driver Authentication Test:
- Login: `driver@edgeai.com` / `password123`
- URL: `http://localhost:3004`

### Driver Delivery Query Test:
**Input**: "How many deliveries do I have?"
**Expected Output**:
```
📋 Your Delivery Schedule:
You have 3 active deliveries:
1. 📦 Roni's Bakery - Status: assigned - £10 earnings
2. 📦 Roni's Bakery - Status: pickup - £11 earnings
3. 📦 Roni's Bakery - Status: in_transit - £12 earnings
```

### Driver Earnings Test:
**Input**: "Show my earnings"
**Expected Output**:
```
💰 Today's Earnings:
• Completed deliveries: 2
• Total earnings: £27.00
• Earnings per delivery: £13.50
```

### API Test:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3004/api/test-driver-agent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "how many deliveries do I have", "userId": "4"}'
```
