# 🐳 Docker Containerization & Railway Deployment

## 🚀 Overview
This PR adds comprehensive Docker containerization and Railway deployment support to the EdgeAI Roni's Bakery application.

## ✨ New Features

### 🐳 Docker Support
- **Multi-stage Dockerfile** with security hardening
- **Optimized image size** (1.36GB) with Alpine Linux base
- **Non-root user execution** for enhanced security
- **Automatic SQLite initialization** with proper permissions
- **Health check monitoring** for container management
- **Graceful shutdown handling** with proper signal management

### 🚄 Railway Deployment
- **One-click deployment** with railway.json configuration
- **Environment variable management** with secure templates
- **Production-ready setup** with health monitoring
- **Auto-scaling capabilities** through Railway platform

### 🗄️ Database Improvements
- **Fixed SQLite permissions** for container environments
- **Automatic table creation** and data seeding
- **Proper database file handling** in containerized setup
- **Health check endpoint** for monitoring database status

## 📁 Files Added
- `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage container configuration
- `.dockerignore` - Build context optimization
- `railway.json` - Railway platform configuration
- `health-check.js` - Container health monitoring
- `startup.js` - Database initialization script
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide
- `RAILWAY_DEPLOY.md` - Railway-specific instructions

## 🔧 Configuration Changes
- Updated `next.config.js` for standalone output mode
- Enhanced `.gitignore` for Docker/Railway specific files
- Secure environment variable handling

## ✅ Testing Results
- ✅ Container builds successfully
- ✅ Application runs on port 3000 in container
- ✅ Database initializes automatically
- ✅ All API endpoints functional
- ✅ OpenAI integration working with provided keys
- ✅ Health checks passing
- ✅ Tested locally in Docker Desktop

## 🎯 Production Ready
This implementation is production-ready with:
- Security best practices
- Optimized build process
- Health monitoring
- Automatic scaling support
- Environment-based configuration

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions
1. **Railway**: Use the `RAILWAY_DEPLOY.md` guide for one-click deployment
2. **Docker**: Use `docker build` and `docker run` as documented
3. **Environment**: Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and other variables as needed

## 🧪 How to Test
1. Build: `docker build -t edgeai-ronis-bakery .`
2. Run: `docker run -p 3001:3000 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key edgeai-ronis-bakery`
3. Init: `curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/seed`
4. Test: Visit `http://localhost:3001`

Ready for production deployment! 🎉
