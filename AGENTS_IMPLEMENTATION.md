- Cross-tenant data access is prevented
- User permissions are validated per operation

### Role-Based Access Control
- Tools are restricted to appropriate user roles
- Fine-grained permissions per tool
- Audit logging for all tool usage
- Session management and validation

### Data Protection
- Input sanitization and validation
- SQL injection prevention
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Secure parameter handling

## API Endpoints

### 1. Agent Chat API (`/api/agent-chat`)
**Method**: POST
**Purpose**: Process chat messages with appropriate agents

**Request**:
```json
{
  "message": "Check inventory status",
  "role": "client",
  "tenantId": 1,
  "userId": 123
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "response": "Current inventory shows...",
  "suggestions": ["Create order", "View analytics"],
  "tools_used": ["get_inventory_status"],
  "usage": { "tokens": 150 }
}
```

### 2. Agent Tools API (`/api/agent-tools`)
**Method**: GET
**Purpose**: Get available tools for a role

**Request**: `GET /api/agent-tools?role=client`

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "tools": [...],
  "capabilities": [
    "Monitor inventory levels and stock status",
    "Create and manage purchase orders",
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Database Schema Updates

### Tool Usage Audit Log
```sql
CREATE TABLE tool_usage_logs (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  tenant_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  tool_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  parameters TEXT,
  result TEXT,
  execution_time_ms INTEGER,
  success BOOLEAN DEFAULT 1,
  error_message TEXT,
  created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Updated Components

### Chatbot Components
All chatbot components have been updated to use the new agent system:

1. **ClientChatbot.tsx** - Now uses client agent
2. **SupplierChatbot.tsx** - Now uses supplier agent  
3. **DriverChatbot.tsx** - Now uses driver agent

**Features**:
- Role-specific suggestions and quick actions
- Real-time agent communication
- Error handling and fallbacks
- Responsive design for all devices
- Context-aware conversations

## Installation and Setup

### Dependencies Installed
```bash
npm install @openai/agents @types/uuid uuid
```

### Environment Variables Required
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### Database Migration
The database schema automatically includes the new audit table when `initDatabase()` is called.

## Usage Examples

### Client Operations
```javascript
// Check inventory
"Show me current stock levels"
"Which items need reordering?"
"Create an order for low stock items"

// Analytics
"Show me this week's sales analytics"
"What are my top-selling products?"
"Generate inventory turnover report"
```

### Supplier Operations  
```javascript
// Order management
"Show pending orders"
"Confirm order #12345"
"Assign driver to delivery"

// Performance tracking
"Show my delivery performance this month"
"Which customers order most frequently?"
"Track driver availability"
```

### Driver Operations

// Delivery management
"Show my deliveries for today"
"Get directions to next delivery"
"Mark delivery as complete"

// Earnings and performance
"How much have I earned today?"
"Show my delivery stats this week"
"Update my current location"
```

### Admin Operations
```javascript
// System monitoring
"Check system health status"
"Show tenant usage statistics"
"Generate system performance report"
